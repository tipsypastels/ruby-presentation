<h1>In This Presentation...</h1>
<p>We'll go over the basics of Ruby and how it's used in web dev. We won't go into <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, the popular Ruby web development framework, because we don't have time to explain all the concepts needed, but we will have a look at <em>Rack</em>, a Ruby library that's central to Rails and that allows you to create a simple web server like the ones we've been doing with Node.</p>
