<h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
<p>Arrays work exactly the same as JavaScript so I'm not even going to bother with giving them an example. We all know how to do arrays. "Hashes" are what we in JavaScript would call an object literal. It's a key-value pair in curly braces.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
  user = {
    username: "thekid9203293023",
    post_count: 1,
    permission: :user
  }

  # Access a value like this
  user[:username]
</code></pre>
