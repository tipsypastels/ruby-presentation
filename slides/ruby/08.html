<h2>Symbols</h2>

<pre><code class="ruby">
  :this_is_a_symbol
</code></pre>

Symbols are similar to strings, but they're <em>immutable</em>, and because of that every symbol of the same name refers to the same object in memory. We can test this using the <em>object_id</em> property.

<pre><code class="ruby">
  # Two strings, even if they have the same value, have different object IDs.
  "a".object_id != "a".object_id

  # Symbols don't though.
  :a.object_id == :a.object_id
</code></pre>
