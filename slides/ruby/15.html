<h1>What about functions?</h1>

<p>There are no functions in Ruby. Everything is a method on a class. In JavaScript we're used to using a seemingly random mix of functions and methods, such as isNaN (a function) and toUpperCase (a method). A lot of the time why something is a function or a method isn't very obvious. Ruby, being a pure Object-Oriented language, only has methods.</p>

<p>If you write a method definition outside of a class body, it will automatically be set as a method of the Object class.</p>
