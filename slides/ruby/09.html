This makes symbols hugely more efficient, and popular in cases where you want to store a particular <em>concept</em> rather than <em>content</em>.

<pre><code class="ruby">
  # Things that should be symbols
  mode = :debug
  current_heading = :west
  permission_level = :admin

  # Things that should be strings
  class_name = "Web Technology"
  url = "https://ruby-lang.org"
  folder = "public"
</code></pre>
