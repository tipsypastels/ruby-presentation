<h2>Why use procs?</h2>
<p>In most languages, it is possible to refer to a function/method without <em>calling it</em>. For example, in JavaScript, just putting in a function name and not including parentheses at the end will refer to it rather than calling it. You can use this to, for example, pass the function to another function as a callback.</p>

<p>In Ruby, that's not possible, because the parentheses are optional when calling a method - there's no way to simply refer to a method as an object instead of calling it. Because of that, we need a seperate way of storing behavior that can be passed around, and that's what procs are for.</p>
