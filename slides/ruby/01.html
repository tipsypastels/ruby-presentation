<h1>About</h1>
<p>Ruby is a dynamic scripting language developed in Japan in the 90s. In functionality it's similar to JavaScript, in syntax it's similar to Python.</p>

<p>Ruby's strengths are versatility, ease of use, and metaprogramming. The language allows a certain amount of "syntax sugar" not found in most other languages, which allows code to be more readable and English-like.</p>

<p>Ruby usually comes pre-installed on Mac and Linux. Files have the <em>.rb</em> extension and are run with the <em>ruby</em> terminal command. You can also use the <em>irb</em> command to start an interactive environment.</p>
