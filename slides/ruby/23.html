<h2>Rack</h2>
Rack is a simple framework used to make a web server. It's used in Ruby on Rails and nearly every Ruby web framework. The base functionality is incredible simple.

<pre><code class="ruby">
  require 'rack'

  site = proc do |env|
    ['200', {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ['get rack\'d']]
  end

  run site
</code></pre>

<p>It's not recommended to use a regular Ruby file for your rack server. Instead, convention is to name the file <em>config.ru</em>, which lets you run it using the <em>rackup</em> console command.</p>
