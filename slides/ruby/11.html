<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A method is created with the <em>def</em> keyword, a name, and then an <em>end</em>.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
  def say_hello
    puts "Hello!"
  end
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that we didn't need parentheses either after the <em>say_hello</em> or around the parameters to <em>puts</em>. In Ruby, parentheses in both method calls and method definitions are optional. You can use them in cases where you have an order of operations issue, like in math, but often they can be left out. This is one of the things that leads to Ruby being more natural to read, though it can be confusing for beginners.</p>
