<p>"Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves." - Yukihiro Matsumoto</p>

<p>The purpose of Ruby is to make programming fun for humans, not necessarily efficient for computers. Because of this it's not all that fast a language, but it's still fast enough for many commercial applications (though you wouldn't use it to write games). Ruby's nice syntax make it easy to learn and to be productive in.</p>
