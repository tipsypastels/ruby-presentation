<h1>About</h1>
<p>Ruby is a dynamic scripting language developed in Japan in the 90s. In functionality it's similar to JavaScript, in syntax it's similar to Python.</p>

<p>Ruby's strengths are versatility, ease of use, and metaprogramming. The language allows a certain amount of "syntax sugar" not found in most other languages, which allows code to be more readable and English-like.</p>
